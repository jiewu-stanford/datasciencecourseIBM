    "The consumer business in New York and Toronto are studied and compared by analyzing the top venues of their key boroughs---Manhattan and Toronto borough.  The venue data are collected from Foursquare based on which the neighborhoods are clustered and the distinguishing categories of the venues are identified.  The analysis reflects a more developed and well-rounded consumer business in New York suggesting a better opportunity of starting up or expanding a consumer business in Toronto.  The insight obtained from this study should be useful to consumer business managers and/or investors exploring business opportunities in one of these two cities."

    "The consumer business of the key boroughs of New York and Toronto are depicted using the venue location data retrieved from Foursquare.  The key boroughs chosen are Manhattan and Toronto borough respectively, the latter including east Toronto, west Toronto, central Toronto and downtown Toronto.  The choice of borough is partly based on the business districts, financial status and population of the borough compared to the other boroughs of the cities and partly for the sake of comparison---each borough contains roughly the same number of neighborhoods, 40 for Manhattan borough and 38 for Toronto borough.  To avoid verbose exposition in the following the word borough will be dropped and the two boroughs are simply referred to as Manhattan and Toronto (the latter should not be confused with Toronto as a city)."

    "First a list of top 100 venues within 500 meters of the neighborhood's geographic coordinates (i.e.\\ latitude and longitude) are collected from Foursquare for each neighborhood.  The rankings are based on the popularity of the venues among Foursquare users.  Giving that Foursquare is among the top three location data providers hosting over 60 million users the bias should be minimal.  Moreover the number of venues considered is 100 which should be sufficient to portraying the consumer business in the neighborhood.  The radius of the search is chosen according to the typical size of a neighborhood.  Therefore the choice of 500 meters should be appropriate to not only include the vast majority of the consumer business within a particular neighborhood but also prevent the analysis from being affected by the consumer business of nearby neighborhoods."

    "After the top 100 venues are collected for each neighborhood within a distance of 500 meters the categories of the venues are retrieved and consolidated to reveal the richness of the consumer business of New York and Toronto.  Then the top 10 categories of venues are identified for each neighborhood based on the mean of the frequency of their occurrence.  The purpose of the identification is to characterize the consumer business of the neighborhoods and group neighborhoods with similar characteristics.  The neighborhood clustering is determined using the k-means clustering algorithm where the coordinates of the neighborhoods are the mean of the occurrence frequency of the various venue categories.  Finally the neighborhoods are and plotted in the maps of the two cities and labeled with their cluster labels.  The distributions of the various neighborhood clusters of New York and Toronto are compared to reflect the distribution of the types of consumer business and the business opportunities are assessed."
